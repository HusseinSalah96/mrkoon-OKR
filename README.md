## 🏢 Business Logic & Rules

The system is built around a hierarchical evaluation model involving **Admins**, **Managers**, and **Employees**.

### Core Concepts
1.  **Evaluations**:
    - Conducted **Quarterly** (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4).
    - Consist of **KPI Groups** (e.g., "Technical Skills", "Soft Skills") and specific **KPI Items**.
    - Each KPI Item has a **Weight** and a **Score** (0-100).
    - Calculated Score = `(Sum(Item Score * Item Weight) / Total Weight)`.
    
2.  **Teams**:
    - Users are organized into Teams.
    - Each Team has one **Manager**.
    - Managers evaluate their team members.

### 🔒 Roles & Permissions

#### 1. ADMIN (`Role.ADMIN`)
*   **Access**: Full System Access.
*   **Capabilities**:
    *   **User Management**: Create, Edit, Delete Users. Assign Roles and Teams.
    *   **Team Management**: Create Teams, Assign Managers.
    *   **KPI Management**: Define Global KPIs and Group Weights.
    *   **Evaluations**: Can view ALL evaluations. Can evaluate **Managers**.
    *   **Analytics**: View organization-wide dashboards.
*   *Security Rule*: Admins are redirected to a secure `/admin/users` view after submitting evaluations.

#### 2. MANAGER (`Role.MANAGER`)
*   **Access**: Team-Level Access.
*   **Capabilities**:
    *   **Team View**: View list of assigned team members.
    *   **Evaluation**: Conduct quarterly evaluations for their **direct reports** (Employees).
    *   **Restrictions**:

        *   Cannot see evaluations of employees in other teams.
        *   Cannot see evaluations of other Managers.
    *   **Dashboard**: View team performance stats and personal performance.

#### 3. EMPLOYEE (`Role.EMPLOYEE`)
*   **Access**: Personal Access.
*   **Capabilities**:
    *   **Dashboard**: View own profile.
    *   **History**: View past evaluation results and feedback.
    *   **Restrictions**: Read-only access to their own data.

## 🔐 Security measures
- **Password Hashing**: Bcrypt for secure storage.
- **API Guards**: Endpoints verify `req.user` role before returning sensitive data.
- **Data Scoping**: Services explicitly filter queries based on the requesting user's ID and Role.
